# AI Usage Disclosure

## Overview

This project was developed with the assistance of an AI language model as a collaborative tool.

AI was used to support reasoning, improve clarity, and accelerate iterative development.
All architectural decisions, modeling logic, and validation choices were made deliberately and reviewed manually.

AI did not autonomously design or execute the pipeline.

## How AI Was Used

AI assistance included:

- Discussing modeling strategies and trade-offs  
- Refining SQL queries for clarity and correctness  
- Reviewing pipeline structure and commit strategy  
- Improving documentation wording and structure  
- Challenging metric definitions and edge-case reasoning  

All SQL, Python, and architectural logic was:

- Manually executed  
- Validated against real query results  
- Iteratively refined based on actual outputs  

---

## What AI Did Not Do

AI did not:

- Generate unseen or unverified results  
- Execute queries  
- Access external data  
- Automatically design the dimensional model  

All results shown in this repository are reproducible by running the pipeline locally.

## Engineering Approach

AI was used as a reasoning partner, similar to:

- Code review discussion  
- Design brainstorming  
- Structured thinking support  

Final implementation decisions, data modeling boundaries, and validation rules were determined and tested by the author.
